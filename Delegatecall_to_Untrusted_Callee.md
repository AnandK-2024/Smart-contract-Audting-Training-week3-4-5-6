# DelegateCall or Storage Collision Attack on Smart Contracts

The `CALL` and `DELEGATECALL opcodes` are useful in allowing Ethereum developers to modularise their code. Standard external message calls to contracts are handled by the `CALL opcode` whereby code is run in the context of the external contract/function. The `DELEGATECALL opcode` is identical to the standard message call, except that the code executed at the targeted address is run in the context of the calling contract along with the fact that `msg.sender and msg.value remain unchanged`. 


It allows you to call the code of the callee contract from the caller with the storage context of the caller.

#### when change the order of storage variable of `Contract B`

When we run `DELEGATECALL` the `“num”` value is going to be stored in `storage slot 2` for `Contract A` which maps to the `“value”` state variable. The same applies for when `“value”` is stored its going to update `slot 0` which maps to the `“num”` state variable.
